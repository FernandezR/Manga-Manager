## Set Cover

### How to use it:

Pretty straightforward process:

1. Run script
2. Select all covers you want to apply<br>

3. Select if you want to overwrite or not.<br>

#### Overwrite: YES

~~~~
This will search for the first image and will back it up as OldCover_001.ext.bk and delete it
Then, the script will create a file named 000000.ext with the new cover
~~~~

#### Overwrite: NO
~~~~
This will create a file named 000000.ext.
If there is already an image named that, it will be renamed to OldCover_0000.ext.bk 
~~~~

#### To delete cover:
I click "Delete covers" and select the files which I want to remove the images from.
They will be added to the queue and will be marked with a recycle bin image that says DELETE.


#### How I personally use this tool:

~~~~
The first thing I do is locate the cover images I am going to use. And name them after the volume they are from

Then i press 'Delete cover' and proceed to select all images whom i want their cover removed.

After that I click the button to select the cover images I am going to use.

## Set Volume

### How to use it

1. Run script
2. Change the tool. Select Volume setter in the dropdown at the bottom of the window
3. Click the button to select the files you want to apply the change to
4. Introduce the number of the volume you want to check
5. Click preview to make sure the naming is correct
6. Click proceed will start processing the files

### Settings available:

- **Auto increase volume number after processing:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the processing is done the script will increase volume number by one
- **Open File selector dialog after processing:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the processing is done, the popup dialog to select next files to add volume will appear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This saves time so there is no need to click the button to reselect the files.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideal when adding multiple volumes to files
- **Automatic preview**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table with the preview will be automatically populated right after selecting the files

#### How I personally use this tool:

~~~~
If I want to have vol.1 in 5 names I follow the instructions.
After that I want to rename multiple files to have vol.2 in its name.
I can just click the select files button and change the number inside of the entry box~~~~~
